# HW-Wireframe

___

The first homework assignment involved creating a wireframe or mockup website layout in HTML/CSS. The HTML document incorporates the following elements: header, nav, footer, aside, and a section containing an article with heading and and p elements within.  The specific layout of the wireframe called for the header and nav elements to be placed above the section floating left, aside floating right, and footer at the bottom of the page.  The margins, padding, white text color, grey background coloring, and alignment were formatted using an external style sheet in CSS.
